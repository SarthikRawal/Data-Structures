Map

A map is an ordered collection of key-value pairs. both key & values can be of any data type.

To retrieve a value, you can use the corresponding key.
Maps are iterables. They can be used with a for loop.

Objects vs Maps

Objects: Keys in objects can only be strings or symbols. Attempting to use a different data type as a key will convert it to a string. Onjects are not directly iterable.

Maps: Keys in maps can be of any data type. This allows for more flexibility in how you structure your data. Maps are iterable using for..of loop


Aprt from storing data, you can attach functionality to an object whereas amaps are restricted to just storing data.
