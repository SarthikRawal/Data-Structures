Tree data structure:
Is a hierarchical DS that consist of nodes connected by edges each node stores data.

- it is a non-linear DS that helps in quciker & easier access to data.

Nodes and Edges: Trees are composed of nodes connected by edges. Each node contains data and links to its child nodes.

Root Node: The topmost node in a tree, which has no parent.
Leaf Nodes: Nodes that do not have any children.

Traversal Techniques

- In-order Traversal: Visit the left subtree, the root node, and then the right subtree. Used to retrieve values in sorted order in BST. [ L - ROOT - R ]

- Pre-order Traversal: Visit the root node, the left subtree, and then the right subtree. Useful for copying trees. [ ROOT - L - R ]

- Post-order Traversal: Visit the left subtree, the right subtree, and then the root node. Used for deleting trees. [ L - R - ROOT ]
